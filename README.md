# Brand Guider

Brand Guider is a minimalist web tool that helps brands assemble a complete set of
visual guidelines. Pick typography, colours and logos while previewing changes in
real time.

## Features
- **Typography** – choose from popular Google Fonts, adjust weights and heading styles.
- **Colours** – pick primary and secondary colours to build your palette.
- **Logos** – upload a logo and preview variations on different backgrounds.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Use the controls on the left to customise your brand settings.
3. See updates instantly in the preview area and download/save as needed.

## Development
No build step is required. The project is fully static.

To run a placeholder test script:
```bash
npm test
```
This will output a message indicating there are no tests yet.
